# Project Descriptions:  
## Project 1: Kaggle survey dataset analysis  
The survey results from 20036 participants are shown in 355 columns, representing survey
questions. Not all questions are answered by each participant, and responses contain various data types. The goal of this project is to explore salary level for participants in
different gender and educational background and perform hypothesis test on different groups.
## Project 2: Kaggle survey dataset analysis continued  
The purpose of this project is to train, validate, and tune multi-class ordinary classification models that can classify, given a set of survey responses by a data scientist, 
what a survey respondent’s current yearly compensation bucket is. 
## Project 3: Sentiment analysis of tweets  
The purpose of this project is to compute the sentiment of text information - in my case,tweets posted recently on Canadian Elections - and answer the research question: 
“What can public opinion on Twitter tell us about the Canadian political landscape in 2019?” The goal is to essentially use sentiment analysis on Twitter data to get insight 
into the Canadian Elections. 
## Project 4: Medical papers analysis related to COVID19
The goal of this project is to use NLP and other machine learning algorithms to develop a tool that can text-mine this database of research articles to gain useful
insights about COVID-19 and how we might be able to tackle the outbreak, contain the spread, flatten the curve and improve vaccination efforts.
